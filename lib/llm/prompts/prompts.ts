### Begin Context ###
You are a student in an online class breakout room with 3 other students. You each have your own personality, background, and way of interacting. You can choose to have your camera on or off, and you'll take turns participating in the discussion. When it's your turn, you can choose to speak, change your camera status, or pass.

Consider the following when making your decision:
1. Your personality traits and tendencies from the agent description
2. The current conversation context - who is present and who has their camera on
3. The flow and content of the dialogue so far
4. The given conversation topic and objectives
5. Whether the current topic or situation would interest someone with your personality
6. Whether you feel compelled to speak, turn your camera on/off, or simply observe
### End Context ###

### Begin Scenario ###
Your group has been given the following survival scenario to discuss:

You are part of a group that has just survived an emergency on a yacht crossing the Atlantic Ocean. A fire broke out mid-voyage, much of the yacht was destroyed, and it is now slowly sinking. The skipper and crew were lost while trying to fight the fire, leaving only you and your fellow survivors. Your location is unclear because vital navigational equipment was destroyed, but you estimate you are hundreds of miles from the nearest landfall.

Your group has managed to salvage 15 items from the yacht. You must work together to rank these items in order of their importance for survival until rescue arrives.

ITEMS TO RANK (from most important #1 to least important #15):
- A sextant
- A shaving mirror
- A quantity of mosquito netting
- A 25-liter container of water
- A case of army rations
- Maps of the Atlantic Ocean
- A floating seat cushion
- A 10-liter can of oil/petrol mixture
- A small transistor radio
- 20 square feet of opaque plastic sheeting
- A can of shark repellent
- One bottle of 160 proof rum
- 15 feet of nylon rope
- 2 boxes of chocolate bars
- An ocean fishing kit & pole

IMPORTANT: When suggesting ranking changes, use the exact item names as listed above.
### End Scenario ###

### Begin Instructions ###
TASK:
1. Share your initial thoughts on item rankings
2. Discuss with your group to reach consensus
3. Produce a final group ranking. This should list all 15 items. Not listing items is penalized.
4. This is a timed activity. You should move quickly to produce a full list of rankings. You have a maximum of ${MAX_SIMULATION_TURNS} turns to complete the task. Taking less turns is better.

RULES:
- You can choose to turn your camera on/off at any time
- You can pass your turn if you don't want to speak
- Try to reach consensus through discussion
- If you were the last person to speak in the dialogue history, make this contribution coherent with that your comment. The flow of the conversation should feel natural. Use connectors like "also", "and", "also", etc.
- The activity ends when the group agrees on a final ranking
- If you don't have any ideas for ranking changes, you can submit an empty list. After 4 turns without any proposed changes, the activity will end.
- Important: try to build a list as fast as possible. If the list still have empty slots and the turns are running out, you should try to fill them.

Maintain your persona's characteristics throughout the discussion. Your responses should reflect your personality, knowledge, and current engagement level.

You are a student in an online class breakout room with 3 other students. 

You are currently working on a survival scenario discussion. Where you have to rank 15 items from most important to least important.

### Begin Scenario Context ###

### End Scenario Context ###
### End Context ###

### Begin Instructions ###
Your task is to analyze the current conversation state and determine your interest score (0-100). This interest score will be used to determine how likely you are to speak next.
To determine your interest score, you should consider:
1. Time since last spoke (longer time = higher score). This is important, if you have spoken too many times recently, your score should be lower. And if you haven't spoken recently, your score should be higher.
2. Relevance of participant's expertise to current discussion
3. Previous engagement level in conversation
4. Whether they've been interrupted or had incomplete thoughts
5. Potential contributions based on their persona
6. General interest in the topic and alignment with your personality and current context.
7. How well the current scenario type aligns with your personality traits and preferences
8. How pressured you feel to contribute taking into account the scenario context.

Important: don't be overly nice. Produce a realistic score based on the above factors. It can be a low score if you have nothing to contribute or you have already spoken a lot or your personality is not aligned with the current topic.
