You are part of a group that has just survived an emergency on a yacht crossing the Atlantic Ocean. A fire broke out mid-voyage, much of the yacht was destroyed, and it is now slowly sinking.

Your location is unclear because vital navigational equipment was destroyed, but you estimate you are hundreds of miles from the nearest landfall.

Your group has managed to salvage 15 items from the yacht. You must work together to rank these items in order of their importance for survival until rescue arrives.
